    "This is the simplest algorithm, but is slow. We usually start by finding 2 values of $x$, $x_1$ and $x_2$, such that $f(x_1)$ and $f(x_2)$ have different signs. Set $I = [x_1,x_2]$. We bisect the interval $I$ by taking the midpoint and evaluating the function at that point. After which, we replace the interval with another that has half the width. Below is an image of the process taken from wikipedia.\n",

    "Usually, the function $f$ is called the *objective function*, and most algorithms have a *tolerance level* that is related to the *criterion for convergence*. For an algorithm that finds the roots of the equation, it will be deemed to have converged to the solution $x=x^*$ when $|f(x^*)| < T $, where $T$ is the tolerance level. "

    "The previously mentioned method of bisection has a *linear convergence*, which means that the precision of the solution is approximately equal to the number of steps used in the iteration. Typically, we want to look for methods that have faster convergence, for example *quadratic convergence*. To be more precise, in quadratic convergence, the error at the $(n+1)$ th iteration is approximately equal to the square root of the error at the $n$ th iteration."
