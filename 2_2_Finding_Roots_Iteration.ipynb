    "This is the simplest algorithm, but is slow. We usually start by finding 2 values of $x$, $x_1$ and $x_2$, such that $f(x_1)$ and $f(x_2)$ have different signs. Set $I = [x_1,x_2]$. We bisect the interval $I$ by taking the midpoint and evaluating the function at that point. After which, we replace the interval with another that has half the width.\n",
    "\n",
    "Usually, the function $f$ is called the *objective function*, and most algorithms have a *tolerance level* that is related to the *criterion for convergence*. For an algorithm that finds the roots of the equation, it will be deemed to have converged to the solution $x=x^*$ when $|f(x^*)| < T $, where $T$ is the tolerance level. "
