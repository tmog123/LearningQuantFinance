    "# Utility Theory #\n",
    "\n",
    "Any investor will have a different optimal portfolio, which depends on his attitude to risk and his perceived trade-off between risk and returns. To calculate an optimal portfolio in a mathematical framework, one needs to devise a quantitative way to describe one's preferences, otherwise called an *utility function*\n",
    "\n",
    "Utility functions need to obey some rules, which are somewhat natural.\n",
    "\n",
    "1) *Transitive preferences* imply that if one prefers $A$ to $B$ and prefers $B$ to $C$, then he must prefer $A$ to $C$.\n",
    "\n",
    "2) *Independence* implies that if one is indifferent between $A$ and $B$, then he must also be indifferent between the two gambles $G_1$ and $G_2$, where \n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "G_1 = \\{ A \\text{ with probability }p \\text{ and } C \\text{ with probability } 1-p \\}, \\\\\n",
    "G_2 = \\{ B \\text{ with probability }p \\text{ and } C \\text{ with probability } 1-p \\}.\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "3) *Certainty equivalence* implies that for any gamble, there will be a certain equivalent value such that the investor is indifferent between the gamble and the certain equivalent.\n",
    "\n",
    "4) *Stochastic dominance* implies that if we have two games $G_1$ and $G_2$ over outcomes $A$ and $B$. If one prefers $A$ to $B$, and $G_1$ associates a higher probability of $A$ than $G_2$, one must prefere $G_1$ to $G_2$.\n",
    "\n",
    "These four rules are sufficient to show thhat an utility function $U(W)$ exists, which assigns a real number to any monetary amount $W$ the investor might have, which is known as the *wealth*.\n",
    "\n",
    "An *investment* can be defined by a probability distribution over the possible outcomes. The *expected utility* of an investment $P$ is defined as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "E[U(P)] = \\sum_i^n p_i U(W_i),\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $W_i$ are the possible outcomes, and $p_i$ are the corresponding probabilities of obtaining those outcomes.\n",
    "\n",
    "The utility function is needed to order different investments so that one can choose between them. \n",
    "\n",
    "It can be shown that a utility function is only unique up to an *increasing affine transformation*. Put in other words, if we have two utility functions $U_1$ and $U_2$, the way they order different investments will be identical if:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "U_1(W) = a + b U_2 (W),\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "when $b > 0$. This property also implies that the absolute value of the utility function does not mean anything, only the way it orders choices is meaningful. It is always possible to translate the expected utility into meaningful measures. \n",
    "\n",
    "We also define the *certainty equivalent* of an uncertain investment $P$ as the monetary value $CE(P)$ that has the same utility as the expected utility of the investment, $U(CE(P)) = E(U(P))$. This can be interpreted as the equivalent value of money that one would be indifferent in receiving versus the investment."

    "#### Risk Preference ####\n",
    "\n",
    "We now want to look at the shape of the utility function. Typically, we demand that the utility function is a strictly monotonic increasing function, which makes sense as more (money) is usually better. In other words, the first derivative is always positive, $U^\\prime(W) > 0 $. However, the second derivative, $U^{\\prime \\prime}$, can be wither positive, zero, or negative. This value is used to characterize the *risk preference* of the investor.\n",
    "\n",
    "* If $U^{\\prime \\prime}(W) > 0$, the utility is a convex function of $W$, and there is an increasing maginal utility of wealth. This investor is said to be *risk loving*.\n",
    "\n",
    "* If $U^{\\prime \\prime}(W) < 0$, the utility is a concave function of $W$, and there is an decreasing maginal utility of wealth. This investor is said to be *risk adverse*.\n",
    "\n",
    "* If $U^{\\prime \\prime}(W) = 0$, the utility is linear in $W$. This investor is said to be *risk neutral*.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let us denote by $\\mu_P$ and $\\sigma_P$ the expectation and standard deviation of an investment $P$, otherwise denoted as $\\mu_P = E(U(P)), \\sigma_P^2 = V(U(P))$. If we consider a taylor expansion of $U(P)$ around $\\mu_P$ to the second order, and take expectation of that expansion, we get the following approximation to the expected utility of an investment:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "E(U(P)) \\approx \\mu_P + \\frac{1}{2} \\sigma_P^2 U^{\\prime \\prime} (\\mu_P).\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "* If $U^{\\prime \\prime}(\\mu_P) > 0$ then $CE(P) > \\mu_P$ and the investor values an uncertain investment more than its expected value. In other words, he values a gamble more than a safe investment.\n",
    "\n",
    "* If $U^{\\prime \\prime}(\\mu_P) < 0$ then $CE(P) < \\mu_P$ and the investor values an uncertain investment less than its expected value. In other words, he values safe investments more than a gamble.\n",
    "\n",
    "* If $U^{\\prime \\prime}(\\mu_P) = 0$ then $CE(P) = \\mu_P$, and the investor neither prefers safe investments nor gambling.\n",
    "\n",
    "Typically we obtain the utility function of an individual investor by taking note of the choices that investor will make when presented with investment choices. The utility function is merely a mathematical way to encode these preferences.\n",
    "\n",
    "One can determine the *absolute risk tolerance* of a risk averse investor by presenting him with the following question: Suppose one can bet $X$ dollars on a gamble where one receives either $2X$ or $0.5X$ with equal chances. What would be the maximum amount one is wiling to bet. The answer is ones absolute risk tolerance, and the reciprocal is called the *absolute risk aversion coefficient*. A similar question can be put across to determine the *relative risk tolerance*, where one bets a certain proportion $x$ of ones wealth $W$, with equal chances of obtaining $2xW$ or $0.5xW$. The $x$ given is the relative risk tolerance, and the reciprocal is the *relative risk aversion coefficient*.\n",
    "\n",
    "Typically, it is normally assumed that investors are risk averse, and adopt concave utility functions. This is due to the fact that other investors could take advantage of the fact that an investor is risk loving."

    "#### Coefficients of Risk Aversion, Standard Utility Functions ####\n",
    "\n",
    "The degree of risk aversion of an investor (the degree of concavity of the investors utility function) is commonly measured by the *coefficient of absolute risk aversion*:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "A(W) = \\frac{-U^{\\prime \\prime}(W)}{U^{\\prime}(W)},\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "or by the *coefficient of relative risk aversion*:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "R(W) = \\frac{-WU^{\\prime \\prime}(W)}{U^{\\prime}(W)}.\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking at a logarithmic utility function $U(W) = \\ln(W)$, we can see that the use of this function causes the absolute risk aversion to decrease as one gets wealthier. This means that the investor is more willing to put a larger absolute value of his investment in riskier assets as he becomes more wealthy. However, we also see that the relative risk aversion is constant. This means that even though the absolute value of the investment in riskier assets increases with larger wealth, the proportion of that to his total wealth remains equal. The logarithmic utility function is known as CRRA, or *constant relative risk aversion*.\n",
    "\n",
    "Other than that logarithmic utility function, some other utility functions used are variants of the power utility function, $U(W) = (1+b W)^a $, where $a < 1$ and $b > 0$. This can give rise to utility functions that are CARA, or *constant absolute risk aversion*. By setting $a=1$ in the power utility function, we get a linear utility function which has CARA equal to 0. \n",
    "\n",
    "Another utility function is the *exponential utility function*, $U(W) = - \\exp (- \\gamma W)$, where $\\gamma > 0$. This has CARA equal to $\\gamma$. This exponential utility function is a good choice for investors who want to hold the same absolute dollar amount in risky assets as his wealth increases.\n",
    "\n",
    "The coefficient of absolute risk aversion is typically not very intuitive. It is usually easier to express the exponential utility in terms of the *coefficient of absolute risk tolerance*, which was discussed earlier. This is measured in the same units of wealth.\n",
    "\n",
    "If an investor wants to invest a larger percentage of his wealth in riskier assets with increasing wealth, he can consider using the quadratic utility function, $U(W) = W - aW^2$., where $ a > 0$. Note that this only has increasing maginal utility when $W < (2a)^{-1}$, which limits the domain for it to be used.\n",
    "\n",
    "We lastly want to mention the *CRRA Property* and the *CARA Property*.\n",
    "\n",
    "* CRRA Property: If $CE$ is the certain equivalent of an uncertain state of wealth $W$. Then for any $\\lambda > 0$, $\\lambda CE$ is the certain equivalent of the uncertain wealth $\\lambda W$. We sometimes refer to CRRA utility functions as having the *lambda property*.\n",
    "\n",
    "* CARA Property: If $CE$ is the certain equivalent of an uncertain state of wealth $W$. Then for any $\\delta$, $CE+ \\delta $ is the certain equivalent of the uncertain wealth $W + \\delta$. We sometimes refer to CARA utility functions as having the *delta property*."

    "The last thing we discuss here starts from the point of finding out the certain equivalent of a particular investment. Let us suppose the investment returns have a certain distribution, with $\\mu$ being the mean, $\\sigma$ the standard deviation, $\\tau$ the skewness and $\\Kappa$ the excess kurtosis. Let us consider the Taylor expansion of $U(R)$ about $U(\\mu)$, where $R$ is the uncertain return of the uncertain wealth.\n",

    "$$\n",
    "\n",

Furthermore, since $\\sigma^2 = E((R-\\mu)^2)$, $\\tau = \\sigma^{-3}E((R-\\mu)^3)$, and $\\kappa = \\sigma^{-4} E((R-\\mu)^4)$, this allows us to make further connections to the statistics of the investment return distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now suppose the investor has an exponential utility function, or in other words, $U(CE(P)) = \\exp (-\\gamma CE)$. Now using the equations from previously, we get:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\exp (- \\gamma CE) \\approx \\exp (-\\gamma \\mu) \\left( 1 + \\frac{1}{2}(\\gamma \\sigma)^2 - \\frac{\\tau}{6} (\\gamma \\sigma)^3 + \\frac{\\Kappa}{24} (\\gamma \\sigma)^4 \\right).\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",

    "CE \\approx \\mu - \\frac{1}{2}\\gamma \\sigma^2 + \\frac{\\tau}{6} \\gamma^2 \\sigma^3 - \\frac{\\Kappa}{24} \\gamma^3 \\sigma^4,\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where we remember again that $\\Kappa = \\kappa-3$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now let us assume that the returns distribution from an investment portfolio is a normal distribution with no skewness and excess kurtosis, $CE \\approx \\mu + \\frac{1}{2} \\gamma \\sigma^2$. The best investment is the one that gives the maximum certain equivalent. For a portfoluo, the expected portfolio return is:\n",

    "$$\n",
    "\\mu = \\vec{w}^T E(\\vec{r}),\n",
    "$$\n",

    "where $\\vec{w}$ is the vector of portfolio weights and $\\vec{r}$ is the vector of returns on the constitutent assets. The portfolio variance is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\sigma^2 = \\vec{w}^T V \\vec{w},\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $V$ is the covariance matrix of the asset returns. Thus, for this investor, the optimal way for him to allocate the assets is given by:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\max_{\\vec{w}} \\left[ \\vec{w}^T E(\\vec{r}) - \\frac{1}{2}\\gamma \\vec{w}^T V \\vec{w} \\right].\n",
