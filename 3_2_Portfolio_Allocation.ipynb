    "Let us suppose that asset 1 has already been chosen, with the weight $w$ fixed. We still are able to choose asset 2. All the assets we can choose from have the same return volatilities but different correlations with asset 1. One can ask how the correlation will affect the overall portfolio variance. One can get an analytical form by first rewriting the volatility as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "V(R) = (w \\sigma_1 + (1-w)\\sigma_2)^2 - 2(1-\\rho)w(1-w)\\sigma_1 \\sigma_2.\n",

    "This is a linear increasing function of correlation. The minimum value will occur when $\\rho = -1$ and maximum value when $\\rho = 1$. Thus it is easy to obtain analytical bounds for the variance now.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now let us extend this to a portfolio of $n$ risky assets. The variance matrix $V$ can be written as $V = DCD$, where $D$ is the diagonal matrix of standar deviations and $C$ is the correlation matrix of asset returns. We can show that if the asset returns are less than perfectly correlated, the risk from holding a long-only portfolio will be less than the weighted sum of the component risks.\n",

    "where $\\vec{x} = D \\vec{w}$. If we have perfect correlations ($C = \\mathbb{1}$), then this would yield $ w_1 \\sigma_1 + \\dots + w_n \\sigma_n$. If there is no perfect correlation, then $C$ has elements less than 1. In this case it can be shown that $\\vec{x}^T C \\vec{x} < \\mathbb{1}^T C \\mathbb{1}$. This gives an upper bound for the portfolio variance which we derived for two assets previously. This gives the idea of *portfolio diversification*, which is that holding portfolios that are not perfectly correlated reduces the risk relative to the sum of the risks of the individual positions in the assets.\n",

One would find this in this case by differentiating $V(w)$ and setting the first derivative to $0$.\n",

    "Typically, the shape of the feasible set is determined by the expected returns and the covariance matrix $V$. We want to make two remarks here. Firstly, there is almost nothing one can learn about expected returns from past data. It is usually better to look at current information about the economic climate and other information we have about what is coming ahead. Secondly, the lower the correlations in $V$, we would generally expect the boundary of the feasible set to be more convex. However, there isnt an exact science to generate estimates of $V$. The elements of $V$ can vary considerably depending on the statistical model used to estimate them. Hence, the exact methods we used to generate $V$ can have large effects on the shape of the efficient frontier."

    "#### Optimal allocations ####\n",
    "\n",
    "The shape of the efficient frontier will have great influence on the optimal efficient portfolio. This portfolio is the portfolio on the efficient frontier that is regarded as optimal by an investor. The investor has to specify his preferences and his utility function. Once these are specified, we can generate curves in $\\left\\{ \\sigma,\\mu \\right\\}$ space that joins all points that have the same utility, which are similar to contour lines on a map. These are known as indifference curves.\n",

    "\n",
    "We note that typically, even if one can find an optimal portfolio, it will usually require very frequent rebalancing. This is again due to the shape of the efficient frontier changing very frequently, since it changes everytime the expected returns or estimate of the covariance matrix changes. One would usually like to minimize the amount of rebalancing needed. There are some common methods:\n",

    "* Using subjective forecasts for the covariance matrix and expected returns.\n",

    "* Assigning current portfolio weights as a weighted average of currently recommended and past optimal allocations.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Setting rebalancing limits.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, we need to realize that this is due to inherent problems with the efficient frontier analysis. This fundamentally is due to the fact that asset returns are stationary, short term processes that have no long term memory. Asset prices are the ones that contain memories of the past."
