    "\n",
    "Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is based on the spectral decomposition of a matrix. For a matrix $A$, we aim to find the decomposition $A = W \\Lambda W^\\dag$, where $\\Lambda$ is a diagonal matrix. This is useful as it gives us a transformation to an orthonormal basis for the matrix $A$. It is typically applied on a covariance or correlation matrix."
